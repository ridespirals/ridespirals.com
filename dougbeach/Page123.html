  2. Oddball Margin. Just like baseball, you're going to get a *SCREWBALL* (Ha 
  ha! Get it?) every now and then no matter how accurate your data or procedure

  <p>Note: Contrary to some of you *FOOLS* out there, all of these methods are

    chart and make over 4% on every dollar I bet and live up the highlife.</p>
