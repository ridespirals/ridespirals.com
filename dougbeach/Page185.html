  <p><strong>Q</strong>: <em>Wouldn't there be a tremendous overpopulation problem 
    if everyone lived forever? Crest sounds great and all, but it could get pretty 
    unpleasant if no one ever dies.</em><br>

    allow me to explaine: 7000 yeart ago there such thing call &quot;toothpaste 
    war&quot;. basically entire worldr sector into 3 nation: COLGATE ARMY - AQUAFRESH 
    LEGIONERS - UNITED CREST ALLEGIANCE. all three side battle for soul and see 
    who bettere toothpaste., aquasrfresh not very good so dwindled forces very 
    quickly becasure crest do backstab attack for *3 domage. this anger them so 
    they join COLGATES and become COLGATE BUCKAROOS. the battle between crest 
    and colgates last 100 year and kill 99% of populations but after battle,.,.,. 
    victor emerge.... crestr! ther remain 1% dig to centerm of earth and form 
    new illuminatie organization (AKA MOLE PEOPLE) and nuke earth surface to allow 
    rebuildign of society and create perputual history timeline asr they pull 
    string from belowe earth. this happen every 7000 yaer. so overpopulation = 
    NEVER POSSIBLE. maybes you shoulds go back to history claess?</p>

    style is like poison to my eyes. Go die you waste of space.</em></p>
