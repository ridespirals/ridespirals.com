<div id="container"> faintly remembered being knocked out. &quot;Suprised to see 
  me, Doctor Beach?&quot; he said as he circled the chair &quot;This time you 
  will not so easily escape, no, this time you will not escape at all!&quot; The 
  situation was grim. Doug had previously escaped from Count Chocula's evil catacomb 
  labrynith to foil The Count's plan to eliminate the color green from the world, 
  and The Count held a vandetta for him ever since.
  <p>&quot;howe are did you escape from prison!?! dig hole with spoon? murderous 
    rampager to escape?!? convert youself into liquid-based entity and flusfh 
    youself down toilet?!?!?!&quot; after he was caught, Chocula was sentenced 
    to a bazillion years in prison for terrorism charges and was put into a maximum 
    security facility. To say the least, Doug was boggled. &quot;That is for me 
    to know, and you to ponder. What's more important is this: your current well-being. 
    Tell me Professor, where do you think we are?&quot; Then, it all made sense 
    to Doug, for he knew where he was &quot;candy shoppe?&quot; An angered Chocula 
    shouted &quot;No!&quot; to which Doug responded again with &quot;nail factory?&quot; 
    Chocula's patience was being tested &quot;Argh, you imbecile! We are at the 
    city water treament plant!&quot; </p>
