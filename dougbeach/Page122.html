  <p>[OPTIONAL] 3. Penis Length Law. This is one of my contributions to the charting 
    universe, but has been facing some opposition. You'll need a subscription 
    to one of the more serious charting sites to get the dick length of every 
    player. I recommend www.mlbplaygoshow.biz for purchasing this data. I have 
    compared it to my personal data and they correlate very closey, best of all 
    it's only $99.99 for the data.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are two score scharting laws:</p>
  <p>1. Minnesota Twins / Devil Exception. You may as well flip a coin when it 
    comes to the Twins, as score charting is ineffective for them. I personally 
    place full blame on former Twins player Kirby Puckett, as a little known fact 
    about him is that he was a *SHAMAN* witch doctor and conjured devil powers 
    to help the team win games. Now that he has retired, the Twins are forsaked 
    for eternity and can not be predicted.</p>
