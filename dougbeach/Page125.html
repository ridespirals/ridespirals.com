  Step 4: Buy the book &quot;Score Charting Bonanza&quot; by Yu R. Dipstu. 
  You'll find it in the comedy section of your local book store; rest assured 
  this is just a legal technicality since many people do not accept the true science 
  of charting as fact.
  <p>Step 5: Aquire statistical data. For the sake of this guide I've included 
    a basic 5 year chart ending at the 2002-2003 season in the next section, but 
    you will eventually need better charts. Professional charters do the hard 
    work for you and sell this data on a monthly basis. Most plans constitute 
    a one-time &quot;subscribers fee&quot; usually around $50-$100 then a monthly 
    $10-$20 fee for updated stats. Recommended sites:</p>
  <p>www.thomasgolbysbettingpalace.org - Cheap charts, but the data isn't spot 
    on. Recommended for beginners.<br>
    www.jensen.com/chancing - Best charts money can buy, for the pro charters.<br>
    www.mlbpornoshop.net/vendor/stats/charts.html - Sells genital data on all 
    MLB players; as well as replica penis' for over 200 MLB players.</p>
  <p>Step 6: Continue to read this guide and wonder what you're going to do with 
    all the money you're about to make!</p></font>
