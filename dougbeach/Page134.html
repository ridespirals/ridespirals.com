  FROM : Leon Jeffery<br>
  SUBJECT: Score charting is supposed to be a joke.<br>
  MESSAGE: Hey, I'm Leon Jeffery; I use the writing alias Yu R. Dipstu for my 
  comedy books. Why do you guys take my book seriously? At the front of the book 
  I have a disclaimer saying it's a joke book. There's only one chapter about 
  &quot;score charting&quot; and it involves the main character devising it to scam people. The rest is a romatic comedy about a wheelchair 
  salesman who falls in love with a wheelchair.
  <p>REPLY : Is that so? So you're saying Gary Walton didn't leak your book and 
    secretly publish it to share the score charting formula and only after you 
    put out a lawsuit and forced a *DISCLAIMER* at the start did you hope no one 
    would take the book seriously so you could make all the money charting by 
    yourself? Good attempt Leon, but we know you're a greedy *LIAR*. I bet if 
    you found a cure to cancer you'd keep it to yourself instead of helping humanity, 
    wouldn't you? Off to the e-mail *GARBAGE* bucket for you!</p></font>
