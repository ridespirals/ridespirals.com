  &quot;Ahhh! You broke free and attacked me! Prepare for the final battle.&quot; 
    As he turned his head towards the chair, he saw that Professor Beach was still 
    secured. He looked on the ground to see he had stepped on a dead rat. &quot;Aha! 
    I knew it wasn't you.&quot;
  <p>Doug remained silent and the favour was returned by Chocula. </p>
  <p>After the akward pause, silence was broken &quot;So... Do you get a power 
    bonus if I were to tell you I have your girlfriend captive?&quot; reffering 
    to the cliche hero gimmick of the protagonist gaining super-human powers if 
    his girlfriend who he met 1 hour previous in the book / movie was captured. 
    Doug thought for a minute, then responded &quot;only goku has that ability&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, alright then.&quot; Chocula stood disapointed</p>
  <p>&quot;It's as if I executed the perfect plan. No one can stop me now!&quot; 
    The Count rubbed his hands together, in an evil way. &quot;Do you have any 
    last requests? Being a man of honour that I am, I will honour any request, 
    even those disadvantageous to me should you ask. But you may have only one 
    request!&quot; While not thinking of the longterm situation, Doug asked for 
    some cherry bubble gum. Chocula patted down his cloak only to find Peppermint 
    Extra gum, shrugged, and handed it over to Doug. &quot;Now, ladies and gentlemen, 
    the moment you have all been waiting for!&quot;</p>
  <p>Chocula became visibly nervous &quot;I'm going to do it! I'll poison the 
    water supply!&quot; he said as if he was trying to convince himself. The Count 
    pulled out a gun &quot;The road ends here...&quot; he gulped &quot;Prepare 
    to die, Monsieur Beach.&quot; </p>
