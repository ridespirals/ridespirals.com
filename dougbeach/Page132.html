    SUBJECT: penis girth/length data does not correlate<br>
    MESSAGE: im holding alex rodrigeuzs so called replica penis in my hand right 
    now and i have to vehemently disagree that mlbpornoshop.net has accurate penis 
    length charts. compared to a picture i took of a-rods penis in the locker 
    room i can easily say the replica is AT LEAST 2 inches too big. not to mention 
    i know for a fact wade boggs had a bigger penis size than 4 inches but thats 
    another story. i demand you remove their link from this guide for having incorrect 
    data.</p>
  <p>REPLY : *YOU* can choose what data *YOU* want to use, and *I* will choose 
    what data *I* want to use. It's that simple. The webmaster of mlbpornoshop.net 
    is a close friend of mine and I know the effort involved to get accurate lengths. 
    While you may be right that the size isn't exact, I'd be hard pressed to believe 
    if any penis -- let alone A-Rod's -- would be off by more than half an inch.<br>
