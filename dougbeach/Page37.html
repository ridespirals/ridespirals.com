    this is the most obvious weigh reductions method</div>
  <p> this chapter is broken down into 2 part::: </p>
  <p><strong>1 </strong>continual body mobilization process (exersize)<br>
    <strong>2 </strong>starving youself by only eatign 1/4th or regular food intake 
    (and food itself taste like cardboard with mayonaisse spreads). </p>
  <p>Let Us Tackle Routine 2. let me be first to say it is not as much proper 
    eating routines as it is starving youself and when you cans eat you ingest 
    food equivalent to horse shitr (spellign?) taste. i have a very simple and 
    easy acronym to help you determines if you food is good for you bodyr and 
    soule. if answer is YESR for any question food choice is fail.</p>
  <p>the acronym is ----&gt; <strong>$HlT</strong> (thee l is actually lower case 
    L so acronym shlt)</p>
  <p><strong>$ -</strong> fors money. does cost many money for item? higher price 
    = higher ;likely hood of beign healthy foods<br>
    <strong>H</strong> - for half. isr food in half portion amount of regular 
    foods serve amount?<br>
    <strong>L</strong> - for look. does food appear disgust (ie. shit)? allow 
    35% shit-like familiarity value ;;';;, if 50% not appear like shit it is moste 
    likely fattys food.<br>
    <strong>T</strong> - for taste. does food taste bad? this is most impoirtant, 
    as foods good for yous body has to taste bad reson is because you body does 
    not like you and hafve mind of it own this is key reason why you eat 5lb of 
    chocolate bar everday.</p>
  <p>but again this leads to another problem --- how to remain motivates under 
    strict diets?<br>
