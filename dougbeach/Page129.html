  1st Base - Prepare. Any charter worth his salt has at least 10 years worth of 
  baseball stats cycled yearly. Don't buy *CHEAP* charts either if you think it's 
  going to save you money, because it won't! 
  <p>2nd Base - Predict. Use the math algorithms and quadruple-check the results. 
    Sometimes you might be spending a few hours doing this, but you need to keep 
    at it to get faster. I can chart a game in under 45 minutes, even though I 
    spent 7 hours the first day.</p>
  <p>3rd Base - Choose. Use the Decoder Strip to get the percentile curve for 
    the games. This will tell you which games are *HOT* and which games aren't. 
    Only bet 1 or two games your first weeks of charting.</p>
  <p>Home Base - Wager. To make the over 50% average work in your favour, you 
    need to bet accordingly. On your first ticket bet $5. If you lose, bet $10. 
    If you lose again bet $20. And keep doubling until you win. As you see this 
    ensures that *EVENTUALLY* when you win, you make money even though you may 
    have lost!<br>
    Super Tip: Power chart and make double the money! Instead of betting one ticket 
    a day, bet two or three using the same increment amount. Super boost your 
    potential and bet every game every day! Now that's what I call *SUPER* charging 
    your power chart!<br>
