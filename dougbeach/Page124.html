  **** [SET99] WHAT DO I NEED TO START CHARTING ****<br><br>
  Before you can even think about charting, there's a few things you need:
  <p>Step 1: Back-up and delete your hard disk. For BEOS users you can do this 
    by dragging your SYSTEM folder into the garbage pail and pressing the delete 
    button 5 times. Put all your vital data on floppy diskettes before deleting.</p>
  <p>Step 2: Partition your hard disk data drive. Allocate 200kb of disk space 
    to one drive, and the remaining space to your main drive. Reinstall your standard 
    OS and back-up data on the larger partition.</p>
  <p>Step 3: Download and install the Score Charting Planner OS created by Karl 
    Hoppelheimer on the 200kb partition. It's free for the &quot;simple&quot; 
    version but it's not good enough for true charting. Pick up the pro version 
    for $49.99.<br>
    Super Tip: You can put the OS on a bootable floppy diskette too! Just make 
    a .bat file and merge it onto the .tiz file for the OS and enter this code 
    at the prompt: conglomerate -x myfile.bat + scoreos.tiz /r</p></font>
