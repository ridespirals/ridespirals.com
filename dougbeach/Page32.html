  to </em> 
  <p><strong>DIG BENCH- </strong>NOR! here is diagram of wood door:</p><br><img src="images/woodslide.png">
  <p>notice rough edges on bottom? after sliding you get many splinter and most 
    likely die of blood loss before rob bank. this is not good and in other word 
    not possible.</p>
  <p>on other hand concrete door is very smooth qualities! you can slip under 
    very easy and go on to next step. as mention earlier APPLE SAUCE HELP SLIDE 
    MOTION so if you have this adds +5 to you saving throw.</p>
