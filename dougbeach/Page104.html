  <p> Q: <em>Doug, it doesn't make any sense that 765 shots of 0.999~... would 
    take away 765 HP! He should have 0.000~.....0000.1 (infinity with one at the 
    end!) * 765 left which is 0.0000~....0000765!</em><br>
    A: there are number of problem with youg question: <strong>ONE</strong>: not 
    question! <strong>TWO</strong>: make sense you stupid fucking [peicre of shit 
    asshoel <strong>THREE</strong>: there is no inifity 0.0000~...0001 there is 
    only INFINITY +1 so i recommmned you go backr to sundae school (school with 
    icre cream sundae) and whens you graduate apologize to dourg beah and send 
    5000 dollar cheque to dick foundatioN! NEXT QUESTION!!</p>
  <p>Q: <em>Maybe I'm missing something, but why exactly did we take drugs in 
    the first place if we only ended up kicking the addiction?</em><br>
    A: excelents question allow me to explain: you depress initially becausre 
    diet and excersize fail. to offset yous depression you need to take up drug 
    habits. but this leads to other problemd of ruin you life! so you need to 
    beat drug addictione or you are dead!!! after beat addiction you feel on top 
    of world! there is only one side effect: if fore instance you take herion 
    (or other highly addict drug) there is slight <strong>slight</strong> <strong><em>slioght</em></strong> 
    %90 chance you relapse and take drug again. so thius is nothing to worrey 
    about.</p>
  <p>Q: <em>Can I quit your plan without any ill-effects? I don't think your diet plan is for me anymore.</em><br>
    A: doent fret this is normal reaction for some user of dough beach wellnes 
    palnner! recent articles in scientific journal suggets that if douhg beach 
    book only existeds 20 year ago <strong>holocaust and genocide</strong> would 
    never exist (or happens!). how can your argue with these facxt? dont cut and 
    run or you are no good to society !</p>
