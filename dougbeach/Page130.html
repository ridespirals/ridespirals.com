  **** [RIT99] RITUALS FOR SUCCESS ****
  <p>Alright, I will admit the following rituals have very little scientific basis 
    at the moment but have been *SUSPICOUSLY* true for all the years I charted. 
    It's up to your discretion to apply these methods or not, but don't complain 
    to me when you lose over 3% on your win ratio because you didn't follow my 
    advice.</p>
  <p>1. Ritual of Light. I keep getting hate mail from people accusing me of being 
    racist: this isn't the case. My stats have proven that socializing with black 
    people a week within betting automatically lowers your chance of winning by 
    2%. I'm just the messanger, I actually like black people. My optional idea 
    of swearing at, not looking at, and pushing black people away from you if 
    they get too close is simply a ritual that I firmly believe improves your 
    odds of winning. You can cleanse yourself if this accidentally happens by 
    going to an area, room, or meeting of sorts with a large amount of white people 
    only. I'm not sure how you could find such a place, but I'm sure you Kould 
    Konjure Knowledge from some place to find out such a thing. Also, the darker 
    skin *YOU* are, the less your chance of winning games. I would recommend if 
    you're black to just quit thinking about score charting ever again. <br>
    Super Tip: There's a secret message in this paragraph involving the letter
