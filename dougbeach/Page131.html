  2. Ritual of Purity. On the day of the first game exactly one hour before it 
  begins, rub the ticket stub all over your naked body. And when I mean all over, 
  I mean all over. Don't worry if the ticket gets dirty, you can clean it after 
  you win. I believe this soaks all of your *DESIRE* to win and enchants the ticket 
  by at least %1. Bonus .5% for watching your games naked. 
  <p>3. Ritual of Insight. *ONLY* drink %100 organic Sweet Potato juice in betting 
    season. And yes, I am aware some studies have proven ingesting solely sweet 
    potato juice has been know to cause sudden and massive heart failure, blah, 
    blah, blah, but 500 deaths in the last 3 years does not suggest to me the 
    extreme levels of vitamin H in the diet caused this. This does not increase 
    your odds of winning per se, but will keep you level headed and ensure you 
    don't mess up on the formulas and data. You can easily spend in the upwards 
    of $500 a month on this juice, but if you *POWER* chart you can easily make 
    up the costs.</p></font>
