  **** [HUH99] UPDATE &amp; CHANGE HISTORY ****
  <p>[UPDATE] On April 5th 2005, Frank Joergenson predicted Milwaukee VS Baltimore 
    would result in a shocking 27-0 win for the Orioles. This huge upset and the 
    reverse spread was a x80 bet if the Orioles won by 19 points or more. Frank 
    Jeorgenson sold his 1983 Pinto and his Laptop for $500, in addition to withdrawing 
    his savings that consisted of his life-long winnings of $300. He bet in total 
    $805.73 on the game. The game resulted in a 7-3 victory for the Brewers. After 
    losing all of his money on what he reffered to as the &quot;prophesied game&quot;, 
    Frank Joergenson was found dead by heart failure in his bachelors apartment 
    3 months after his death. In memory of Frank and his contributions to this 
    science, I, dourgh beach, will continue to host and maintain this FAQ as necessary. 
    We'll miss you Frank, may you chart forever in the afterlife.</p>
