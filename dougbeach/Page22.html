<div id="container">my assistantce inform me this chapoter is about government 
  overthrown so that end chapter was to getr you hope up!!! this was partf of 
  thre plan to get you motivates and say &quot;i am doing good jobv this is actual 
  easy!' but it is not easy ancient saying says &quot;the right way and the hards 
  way are always the same way,,, left&quot; this is also to parralel how GOVERNMENT 
  PUT YOU DOWN AND HOW WE ARE (ALMOST) LIVE IN MATRIX GOVERMENT CONTROL PEOPLE 
  AND SAY &quot;helog citizen just flip burger for 5 day and you can retire =|;^) 
  (&lt;---- UNCLE SAM)&quot; but in reality yu flip bourger for 70000 day and 
  only get enough money on retirement to buy peachtree oil! so this is a reality 
  check to keep yous in line. since i am living out of matrix you ask kindyl &quot;doug 
  beach tell me how to break cycle of government&quot;. answers are simple.
  <p>*** first idea is assinate government peopole. so lets say you see goverment 
    personm walk down street lane. if in car run over. if eating bagekl throw 
    bagel at head to distract and pull gun to shootg in heart region 7 time. if 
    have explosiove tapoe them to nhand ask for handshake and explode bomb. you 
    maybe die for doing this but at least gas price will go down min hell (air 
    conditioning very impoirtant in hell -&gt; gas price very important).</p>
  <p>*** second idea complai n and do nothing. this is highly effective startegy 
    but requires 7000 eons in order for government to realise. this is whagt i 
    call &quot;turtle startegy&quot;. very appealign option if you plan to be 
    cyrogenic frozen.</p>
  <p>*** thrid idea. overthorn goverment (a.k.a. che guavarae techniuqe). i explain 
    more later.<br>
