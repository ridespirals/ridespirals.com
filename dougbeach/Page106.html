  <p> <strong>(@)</strong> AOL will certainely not release random search data 
    on internets of people whoe use AOL search because this is privacy concercn 
    and AOL security and pricvacy is #1. foe example there is no such log of 560000 
    search datas with each user as radnom 9 didgetr number and they search term 
    next to them so ie. 87583474378 &quot;i am dougr beach&quot; would still be 
    retain in the log but this is not existed log and never has been exist. only 
    gayr people search engine like WISENUT capable of such thinge.</p>
