<div id="container"> <strong>Comment</strong>: <em>Doug, you make no mention of 
  fruits or vegetables in your book. You do not even speak of the obvious health 
  benefits of organic grown produce. These omissions -- in what is supposed to 
  be a Wellness planner -- reduce your book to pure garbage IMHO.</em><br>
  <strong>Response</strong>: sorry to burts you bubble but you infomation is 132% 
  incorrectg. first of all in chapter 3 i mention HOW TO FRY TOMATO so maybe you 
  should read closer between the line so you donet look like idolt? as for you 
  other stupid remark i do not even know where to begin?<br><br> 
  <u>MYTH (FROM IDIOT LIKE YOU)</u>: foord is &quot;grown&quot;<br>
    <u>TRUE (120% I AM NOT THRE FATHER)</u>: contaray to popular belief food does 
    not grow. how is possible ? simple. you plant seed &gt;&gt; keebler elf take 
    seed and grind into nutmeg. they then return to crime scene after arbitraty 
    month number (ie. 5 month fo tomatoe, 3 month fo cucumber) and they plant 
    vegetables there. if you wonder where they get fruit from it is from magical 
    keebler well with endless fruit supply (it linked to center of the earth wheres 
    the mole people wish ther fruit into existance ands give the fruit in well 
    bucket in exchnage for nutmeg powder (mole people food))
