    there aint no wussy gimmick or cliche here freinds!</div>
  <p> many people buy book because of gimmick or other stupid reason ie. book 
    is romance novel. well when i go on talkr show and people ask me what book 
    about ands i say &quot;well larry kinge that interestes question book is weigh 
    lose manuel and very effective&quot; but as you can see this has limited appeal 
    i need larger audience (larger audience refer to more people and not fat asshoels 
    who weigh 400lbs). so how is possible? cliche appeal chapter! now i can say 
    fantasical thing such as &quot;well tom selleck this graphic novel is about 
    dragon who need to save his burning village but since he is in year 2079 dragons 
    are outlaw and everyone hate and try and kill dragon so the sheriff (play 
    by leslie neilsen) has to catch dragon and put him in jail but by time he 
    track dragon down he fall in love with dragon and they move to appalachian 
    mountain range and live happily ever after as online porno tycoons.&quot; 
    so this chapter dedicates to cliche gimmick appeal to sell moer book copy. 
    enjoyr. </p>
