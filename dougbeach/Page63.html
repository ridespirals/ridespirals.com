  of deduction: keebler elve use pesticide to make ELF DRUGS thuis is why pesticide 
  food grow 700% quicker becausre they take food with pectiscide earlier (for 
  better drugs production). the replacement they use (ie. ONION) is same for either

  <strong>Comment</strong>: <em>Just spotted another error, Doug. I looked at the 
  formula you used to calculate Uncle Fred's wealth, but it doesn't equate even 
  if you consider upwards rounding! You should have converted 4.08^10 to its logarithmic 
  base for the root value of the interest then used a linear matrix to calculate 
  the daily profit.</em><br>
  <strong>Response</strong>: get the fufck out of my book</div>
