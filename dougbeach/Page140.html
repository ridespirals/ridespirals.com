<div id="container"> &quot;arghgh! you never get away with you eviley plan!! p.s. 
  what is you eviley plan&quot; In addition to gaining valuable information from 
  Chocula, Doug was planning an escape route. &quot;Ahhh... I'm glad you asked... 
  As you know General Beach, this world has an addiction to food. Despite the 
  many problems in the world, the populace can never get enough of it and are 
  always reliant on it. I am going to use this very weakness against them... By 
  poisoning the water supply with a formula that will make all who ingest it have 
  an insatiable appetite for chocoberries!&quot; The news hit Doug like a speeding 
  train, his face contorted in disgust Doug screamed &quot;you live in world of 
  strawberry ice cream and peanut juice well guass what pal you dream never become 
  reality!&quot;
  <p>&quot;Oh, but it will. Once I infect the water system with my chocoberry 
    unguent the entire world will be under my control, as you see, I am the only 
    one with a supply of chocoberries to control the populace with their lust 
    of food.&quot; Doug could barely control his own emotions &quot;youy crazy 
    son ofa bitch!!&quot; after which both men stared intensely at each other. 
  </p>
  <p>&quot;I'm going to turn around now, had I done a shabby job of shackling 
    you this would be a prime oppertunity to break free and attack me.&quot; Doug 
    inspected the shackles, he could not make any progress. He needed another 
    plan. Count Chocula was mixing various potions on a table &quot;It would be 
    doubley unfortunate if some kind of lock pick device was on your person so 
    that you could pick the lock off and stab me in the eye with the pick.&quot; 
    Doug felt and inspected himself; no luck there either. &quot;I'm going to 
    leave this laser device turned on, do not even think of shimmying over and 
    trying to use it's cutting power to get free!&quot; Doug slowly moved towards 
    the laser, but it was harmless light and not a cutting device as initially 
    thought. The Count made an akward walk motion to the side, and tripped. <br>
