  <p>5000 years ago... Apollo Beach set forth to the Gobi Desert in search of 
    the ultimate treasure. Fortold to him by a ghost, he was to trek in the desert 
    for 18 days and 23 nights to the exact center of the wasteland. Apollo made 
    the rigourous journey, losing 1 arm and leg in the process. Upon arrival, 
    he was greeted with the awesome power of Crest.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/crest_pillar.png"></p>
  <p>As he approached, a figure from behind the pillar emerged. It was none other 
    than GEROGRE. The two men immediately went to battle, and legend has it that 
    they fought for 50000 eons in a space time warp that only lasted a second 
    in the world we know of. After the dust had settled, Apollo took the Crest 
    and shared it with the world. With the original tube made from grinded rocks 
    and mule shit, Crest evolved through science to become what it is today: The 
    Paste of Immortality.</p>
