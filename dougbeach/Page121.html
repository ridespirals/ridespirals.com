  **** [WHA99] WHAT IS &quot;SCORE CHARTING&quot; ****<br>
  <br>
  Score charting is the prediction of a score for a game, in this instance a baseball 
  game, using data charts. It consists of mathimatical algorithms using stats 
  to output scores. Here are breakdowns of the methods used: 
  <p>1. Base Chart. Your base chart is used as the main variable that eventually 
    spits out the eventual &quot;predicted&quot; score of the game. This is the 
    heart and soul of score charting.</p>
  <p>Algorithm = (((team+0.2)*(codep-oppenent_codep)/(weight/<br>
    (height_feet*(height_inch/100)))+moon_align_to_pluto_<br>
    in_radians)*wins/loses+ties/(game_time_GMT+3)*<br>
    (wheather_kelvin/.25)+(frank_thomas_on_team=true:false))+<br>
    ((points_for-points_against)/total_games_played))=Score<br>
    Percentage Yeild = 51-54% Depending on stat depth</p>
  <p>2. Otis Nixon Rule. Named after the most famous genital scratcher in baseball 
    history at a stunning 49.7 DSPH (dick scratches per hour). The higher the 
    DSPH average on a team, the higher they will score. While not fully understood, 
    the 1-2% yeild doesn't lie folks! <br>
    Super Tip: Dick scratches are only constituted if they are on the playing 
    field, and a 5 game sample is needed to ensure accurate data.</p>
