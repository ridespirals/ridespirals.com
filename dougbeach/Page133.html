  FROM : Kyle Samson<br>
  SUBJECT: You couldn't be more right!<br>
  MESSAGE: In the last 10 days I added the Penis Length rule into effect for my 
  charting. My percentage average has risen from 52% to 54% in just these 10 days!
<p>REPLY : I'm not a conspiracy nut and I'm certainly not crazy, but when you 
    see differential percentages in the upwards of 2% on the penis length rule, 
    you start to throw logic out the window for the sake of your wallet. I stringently 
    test this method on a daily basis, and the results are always positive.</p>
  <p>FROM : Gerald Dixon<br>
    SUBJECT: Can't seem to win.<br>
    MESSAGE: I've tried every charting method there is. I've wagered at least 
    50 times now using the methods and I have only won once, I'm over 5K in the 
    hole now. What am I doing wrong? It seems like using the statistics to predict 
    the game is better than the chart formula, IMHO.</p>
  <p>REPLY : What a suprise, another chart hater in disguise. If it doesn't work, 
    you're doing it *WRONG*. Your idea of *GUESSING* who the better team is by 
    using absurd theories such as &quot;player skill&quot;, &quot;wins and losses&quot;, 
    and &quot;hometeam advantage&quot; is a big fat pile of horse manure.</p>
