  **** [WHO99] ABOUT THE AUTHOR ****<br><br>
  My name is professorf dougr beach. I've been charting ever since the release 
  of &quot;Score Charting Bonanza&quot; 18 years ago. I have a lifetime win rate 
  of 54%, and hold the single season record for a 57% win ratio in the 1994-95 
  season. I've been offering my professional services to people who want to learn 
  charting, and have also contributed new formulas and methods to make more accurate 
  charting possible. I run the website www.geocities.com/chartingforcooldudes/, 
  where you can find this guide and many other useful things associated with charting. 
  <p>If you happen to see my webspace transfer limit exceeded or see obscene content 
    (ie. a goat penis) on the front page instead of my usual homepage with text 
    and links, this is because of recent cyber-terrorism attacks on my site. I 
    am upgrading to Fatcow hosting soon and I will have 50 mb of bandwidth and 
    SecureLink 8byte SSL encryption codes for my password log-in.</p>
